# Background Project
- Diabetes is a chronic condition in which the body is unable to properly regulate its blood sugar levels. It is a common condition, affecting millions of people worldwide. 
- Early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes can help prevent complications and improve the overall health of patients. However, 
- Accurately diagnosing diabetes can be challenging, as there are many factors that can affect blood sugar levels, and the symptoms of diabetes can vary widely among individuals.
____

# Problem Statement

Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?
____
# Objective
- Build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on a given dataset of patient information.

- The model should be able to make predictions with high accuracy

- in order to help healthcare providers diagnose and treat diabetes more effectively
____
# Conclusion

- `Decision Tree and XGBoost` achieving 100% accuracy on the training data indication that the model may be overfitting
- `Logistic Regression machine` learning achieving 80% training data and achieving 78% accuracy on the test data
   it means that in ~8 out of 10 cases, the model's predictions will be correct. This is generally considered to be a good level of accuracy, but it is not perfect.
- Collect more data and use it to train model
- Keep experimenting and trying new things to see what works best.
____
# Next DevelopmentðŸš€
- Balancing Data
- Using ANN Algoritm and apply frameworks such as Keras & TensorFlow
